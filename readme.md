# Zero Shot Super Resolution

This repository contains a Keras implementation of the ZSSR project.
It produces state of the art (SOTA) single image super resolution (SISR) out
for in-the-wild images with real world degragation and compression artifacts.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine and on MissingLink's cloud.
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Prerequisites
You need Python 3.6.8 on your system to run this example.

To install the dependency:

First, updating pip is recommended:
```bash
pip install -U pip
```
You are also strongly recommended to use [virtualenv] to create a sandboxed environment for individual Python projects:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Installing

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:missinglinkai/ZSSR.git
```
Install dependency libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
