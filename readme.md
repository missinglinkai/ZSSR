# Zero Shot Super Resolution

This repository contains a Keras implementation of the ZSSR project.
It produces state of the art (SOTA) single image super resolution (SISR) out
for in-the-wild images with real world degragation and compression artifacts.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

You need Python 3.6.8 on your system to run this example.

To install the dependency:
You are strongly recommended to use virtualenv to create a sandboxed environment for individual Python projects:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate the virtual environment:

virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

## Installing

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:missinglinkai/ZSSR.git
```
Install dependency libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
